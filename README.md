## Group 23 Project Proposal - NCAA Division 1 College Basketball Team Ranker

### Problem Definition

In the NCAA, the winner of the basketball tournament is the college team (from Division 1) that scores the most points. Using a dataset, factors such as number of games played, wins, offensive/defensive efficiency, rebound rate, turnover rate and free throw rate, will be used to create a team ranking system for each season. The goal of this project is to predict the top 10 teams over multiple seasons by evaluating the efficiency of the system.
